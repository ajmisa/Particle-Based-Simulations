# Particle-Based Simulations - Master in Chemical Engineering (TU/e)

This repository contains project assignments completed for the **Particle-Based Simulations** course, part of the Master's program in **Chemical Engineering** at **Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different assignment from the course. The assignments involve various numerical and computational techniques used in particle-based simulation methods.

### Key Topics Covered
- Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
- Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)
- Brownian Dynamics (BD)
- Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) calculations
- Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)
- Bond connectivity in bead-spring chain models

## üìñ Documentation
Each assignment folder contains:
- A **README.md** file explaining the objective and implementation details.
- The source code, configuration files, and input data.
- Output examples and result analysis where applicable.

## ü§ù Contributions
This repository serves as a record of completed coursework and is not open for contributions. However, discussions and feedback are always welcome!
